bio: >-
  Currently, I'm a software engineer at Graf Research. Before that,
  I was a systems engineer at Luna Innovations. Before that, I was a
  student at Purdue University studying Computer Engineering. My interests
  cover the intersection of hardware and software, particularly
  web design, computer networks, embedded systems, SoC/ASIC design
  and machine learning.
